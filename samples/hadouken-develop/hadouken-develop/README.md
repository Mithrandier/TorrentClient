Hadouken BitTorrent client
==========================

Hadouken is a BitTorrent client written in C# and designed to run as a Windows Service. It has plugin support and is managed completely through a web UI.

All development is done in the `develop` branch using the Git Flow extension (with default settings).

Building from source
--------------------
To compile, test and package Hadouken in its various flavors, just run `build.bat` which executes the build script. This will output everything (zip/msi package) in the `build` folder.
